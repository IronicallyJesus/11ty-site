**Effective Date:** February 17, 2026

I value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your information when you visit my website.

## 1. Information I Collect

My website is designed to be as privacy-respecting as possible. I do not use third-party tracking services or analytics (like Google Analytics).

### a. Aggregated Statistics
I collect minimal, aggregated data to understand how my content is performing:
- **Page Views:** I track the number of times a page is loaded.
- **Likes:** Users can voluntarily "like" blog posts.
These stats are stored on my server and are not linked to any specific individual.

### b. Security and Rate Limiting
To protect my server from abuse, I may temporarily process:
- **IP Addresses:** Used by my security middleware (express-rate-limit) to prevent automated attacks. These are processed in-memory and are not stored in a permanent database linked to your personal identity.

### c. Local Storage
I use your browser's `localStorage` to store:
- **Theme Preference:** (Dark/Light mode).
- **View History:** To ensure that refreshing a page doesn't artificially inflate view counts.
- **Likes:** To ensure that liking a post doesn't artificially inflate like counts.
- **Form Submissions:** If you use the contact form, your name, email, and message are processed by **Formspree** to deliver your message to me.
- **Consent Status:** To remember whether you have accepted this policy and our use of local storage.

## 2. Third-Party Services
I do not share your data with third parties, with the exception of my contact form handler. My website:
- Uses local fonts (self-hosted).
- Uses FontAwesome (self-hosted).
- Uses Mermaid.js (self-hosted).
- Uses **Formspree** to process contact form submissions.
- Does not contain third-party cookies or external tracking scripts (CDNs).

## 3. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)
Under the GDPR and CCPA, you have the right to:
- Be informed about the data collected.
- Request access to any data I might have (though for most users, I have none).
- Request deletion of data.

Since I do not store identifiable personal data, "access" or "deletion" requests generally apply to clearing your own browser's `localStorage`.

## 4. Contact Me
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach me at:
