            What can I say? I am a husband, a nerd, an ex-gifted student, an engineer, and an immigrant. I came into the United States from Mexico at 5 years old, but even before then I loved taking things apart and finding out how they worked. In my teenage years technology only boosted that tremendously. After high school though, without a clear path to pursue higher education I quickly joined the workforce.

        <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-4">
            Luckily, I landed a tech support position at an ISP, and what first started as just a job, quickly grew into a passion for computer networking. Now, with more than 10 years of experience, I am a highly motivated and adaptable network engineer with a proven ability to troubleshoot and resolve complex network issues. I thrive in challenging environments where I can contribute meaningfully and never stop learning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-4">
            My goal is to leverage my decade of experience to help businesses optimize their network infrastructure for high availability, security, and performance. I believe in a healthy work-life balance, which allows me to stay sharp and bring my best to every project.
